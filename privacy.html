<h1>Overview </h1>

<p>Thank you for helping me advance the development of 3000 microseconds. This beta launch gathers your data from facebook in a similar manner as the final product will, but with some crucial changes particular to the beta phase.</p>

<p>When you log in to Facebook this app uses a combination of client side code (Javascript) and server side code (PHP) to select items from your Facebook data reservoir. It chooses from among your likes, favourite books movies and music and groups to attain a sample of named topics which you are likely to be interested in. It also selects each topics unique Facebook ID, this number is important to comparing whether or not the circle of friends have a shared threshold of interest in any given topic.</p>

<h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

<p>For now the client side code authenticates your use of the app. The server side code fetches data from the Facebook Graph [FIELDS] and rearranges it into JSON format. No additional information is collected and stored by this app (and you can review the permissions of what this app can access by BLAH BLAH). The JSON format of data is the data which the demo.html example of the game will be configured to use in the final launch. This data is stored on the server, and it is named according to your id code. Don't worry however, the recent privacy changes to Facebook's log in platform guarantee that this number is particular to your authenticated use of this app only!</p>

<p>There is nothing stored in the file that can uniquely identify you.  For now each, JSON file is stored seperately in a folder designated for the JSON files. These files are deleted within 24 hours. Once the sorting and searching of shared facebook likes has been optimised it will not be necessary to store individually identified JSON files on the server. Rather a single JSON file will be produced from the sum total of retrieved and sifted interests from the circle of friends who wish to play 3000 microseconds. This file persists for the duration of the game played.</p>

<p>To further alleviate your concerns you can see the code used to run this project at this github account</p>
