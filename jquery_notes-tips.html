http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9936663/return-array-from-json-file-with-jquery <- this less so but variety of responses

"Your issue is that any code outside (and after) the $.getJSON request has already run by the time the $.getJSON response is received."

You are doing an asynchronous request. $.getJSON does not return the result of your callback
You need to pass a callback into your createArray function. Also, if your JSON data is already an array, you don't need to process the response data

The key is that any code that relies on the response from an asynchronous AJAX request, must run (or be called from) inside the callback.

^ this would suck for my purposes if I wished to make sure no data stored locally

the workaround involves declaring an empty array variable beforehand and assigning it accordingly
I then made another level of abstraction and put all of the above in a function where I could assign it to a var in one fell swoop

HOWEVER even with that it means that the prepending of answers to guess to the DIVs will have to take place in one of the callbacks

*despite what was said in some of the above I had the feeling that I couldn't just assign an array to it because of closure as well as async
